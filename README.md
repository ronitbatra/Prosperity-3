LOOK AT BOT TRADING BEHAVIOR. look at bid and ask and attempt to classify historical orders as belonging to a bot. you can then focus on bots individually
HINT 2: FOCUS ON SIGNIFICANT PRICE EVENTS. im talking about trend reversals, large price swings, random spikes, etc. in squid ink. focus your bot analysis on activity around those points if you want a good starting point.
(based on demand): Order sizes are a good starting point for bot grouping. as an additional hint, there is at LEAST one big and one small MM bot in squid, along with some noise traders.
